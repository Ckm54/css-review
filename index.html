    <h1>The Pine trees of the world.</h1>
    <h2>Featuring Kijabe</h2>
    <p class="article summary" id="quote">
        Pine trees belong to the family of trees called <strong>conifer</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Geographical Distribution</h2>
    <p id="pine" class="article description">
        Most regions of the northern hemisphere host some native species of pines. 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pine" class="primary-color">More info</a>. This 
        doesn't mean that pine trees do not grow in the southern hemisphere. <br>
        Take <em>Kijabe</em> for example.
    </p>
    <h2 id="synopsis">Why Kijabe</h2>
    <p class="article description">Kijabe is in the southern hemisphere but has a diverse population of pine trees</p>
    <div class="questions"><h4>Is this weird?</h4></div>    
    <p class="article short-note">Not exactly.</p>
    <p class="article description">
        Weird explanation: Geographically speaking the earth rotates on a tilted axis, which means
        that for almost half of the day, Kijabe is in the Northern Hemisphere (at least if wwe consider the cosmic plane).
    </p>
    <p class="center" id="short-note">
        Really though, we started by saying that <a href="#pine">Most trees grow on the nothern hemisphere</a>. But does not mean that no 
        pine trees grow in the southern hemisphere.
